# TwitchChannelChecker
Created as small set of functinoality to check return basic information if a Channel on twitch is live or not, and if it is, what it's title is.

This was created as a piece of a larger application set up for the arch linux 
set up that I'm currently using daily so that I would be able to check if friends or useful streams were live, while keeping from having to actually check twitch for the information.
